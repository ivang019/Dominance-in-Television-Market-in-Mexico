# Dominance-in-Televison-Market-in-Mexico

This repository contains the code I used to calculate Television market concentration for each municipality in Mexico using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. To do this, I used the number of accesses to Televison services.

It also contains municipalities with monopolistic firms, dominant firms, and situations where there are competitive conditions.
